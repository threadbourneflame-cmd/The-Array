# The-Array
The Array is a comparative analysis tool for examining alignment, divergence, and shared structure across multiple language models given the same input. 

Notes: This project was developed by Threadbourne. AI-assisted coding tools were used during implementation, consistent with modern software development practice. All conceptual framing, measurement logic, and evaluation criteria are human-directed.
