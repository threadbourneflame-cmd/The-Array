# The-Array
The Array is a multi-model consensus engine that enables simultaneous comparison of responses across different AI models. Version 1.0 implements the Multi-Model Consensus Engine with majority report functionality, allowing researchers to identify shared concepts, unique model signatures, and alignment patterns across AI systems. This tool supports empirical research into multi-model dynamics, inter-model coherence, and the emergence of consensus in AI systems. 

Notes: This project was developed by Threadbourne. AI-assisted coding tools were used during implementation, consistent with modern software development practice. All conceptual framing, measurement logic, and evaluation criteria are human-directed.
